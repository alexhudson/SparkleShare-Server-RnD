Demo server instances for SparkleShare
======================================

See discussion at...

https://github.com/hbons/SparkleShare/wiki/Private-notification-server

Two demo client/server instances for SparkleShare. Both do roughly
the same thing: run in the background, and notify attached clients
when the revision for a given repo changes. One is written in plain
python using TCP sockets, the other using zeromq.

The clients have two modes; watch for changes, or notify of a change.
You'd probably not be doing both at the same time: the notification
should probably happen in a git commit hook on the server, and the
watch would happen in the client.

The TCP server has a registration implementation that isn't really
needed on the 0MQ side. This enables clients to register their 
interest in a given repo; they could register for one or more. The
0MQ client would be expected to filter that out (the filter is a 
bit lame currently, but could do the job fine).

Scalability-wise, both are of a similar design: a single event-driven
loop. It's unlikely that either design is going to be maxxed out by
any concievable SparkleShare user any time soon.

Using it
--------

(Demonstrating the TCP version; the 0MQ should be identical).

Start the server simply as so:

  $ ./server/tcp-server.py

On another terminal, we can then start a client watching:

  $ ./client/tcp_client.py watch /home/alex/myrepo.git

The client is now registered to watch /home/alex/myrepo.git with the 
server. It should be noted the repo name is just a string: it could
be the file path on the server by convention; but equally, it could be
anything else to uniquely identify the repo.

Then, a hook might run in a git commit to let us know the revision has
just changed:

  $ ./client/tcp_client.py -revision 99ebff687164b81c9624df8279f128fe notify /home/alex/myrepo.git

You'll then see that the client started earlier has received this 
message:

Received: {"repo": "/home/alex/myrepo.git", "command": "new_version", "revision": "99ebff687164b81c9624df8279f128fe"}
